# ABOUT 
This is a weather deatils website to browse for the weather conditions of any location. I have created it from scrap using HTML and CSS for frontend and NODE.JS for backend.
It has three pages namely 'WEATHER', 'ABOUT' and 'HELP'.
Presently the website design is under process but it functions properly for any location.

# BUILD UP

It is styled with the help of an external CSS file.
All codes are written in Javascript.
It is hosted with the help of Heroku.
